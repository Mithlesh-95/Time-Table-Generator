# Backend API Development Folder

This folder is for all backend/API development work.

**Instructions for Backend Team:**
- **Module 1 (User Auth):** Place authentication-related API endpoints here
- **Module 2 (Master Data):** Place data management APIs here  
- **Module 3 (Curriculum):** Place curriculum management APIs here
- **Module 4 (Scheduling Algorithm):** Place core scheduling logic and APIs here
- **Module 6 (Reports):** Place report generation APIs here

**General Guidelines:**
- Create a well-structured API with proper endpoints
- Follow RESTful API principles
- Document your API endpoints clearly
- **Deployment:** This folder will be deployed to **Render** for optimal Python/Django performance

**Technology Stack:**
- Django + PostgreSQL recommended
- Ensure proper database models and migrations
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Configure CORS settings for frontend communication

**Hosting Strategy:**
- Backend (this folder) → Render deployment (perfect for Python)
- Frontend (frontend folder) → Vercel deployment
- Separate hosting for better performance and scalability

Remember: Work only in your assigned branch and coordinate API endpoints with other modules
