# Frontend Development Folder

This folder is for all frontend development work.

**Instructions for Frontend Team (Module 5):**
- Place all your React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript files here
- Create your components, pages, and assets in this directory
- Follow the project structure suitable for your chosen frontend framework
- **Deployment:** This folder will be deployed to **Vercel** for optimal performance

**Team Members working on Module 5 (Frontend UI):**
- Use this folder for all frontend development
- Keep backend API calls organized and documented
- Ensure responsive design for all devices
- Configure API endpoints to connect with the backend hosted on Render

**Hosting Strategy:**
- Frontend (this folder) → Vercel deployment
- Backend (api folder) → Render deployment
- Separate hosting for better performance and scalability

Remember: Work only in your assigned branch (module-5-frontend-ui)
