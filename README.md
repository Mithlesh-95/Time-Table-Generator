# Getting Started: Complete Setup Guide for New GitHub Users

## Step 1: Clone the Project to Your System

1. **Install Git** (if not already installed):
   - Download and install Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/windows
   - Follow the installation wizard with default settings.

2. **Clone the repository**:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+`` or from the menu: Terminal > New Terminal).
   - Navigate to where you want to save the project (e.g., Desktop):
   ```
   cd Desktop
   ```
   - Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mithlesh-95/Time-Table-Generator.git
   ```
   - Navigate into the project folder:
   ```
   cd Time-Table-Generator
   ```

## Step 2: Switch from Main Branch to Your Module Branch

After you have cloned the project to your system, follow these steps to switch from the main branch to your assigned module branch using the VS Code terminal:

1. Make sure you are in the project directory (should already be there from Step 1).
2. List all available branches to confirm they exist:
   ```
   git branch -a
   ```
3. Switch to your assigned branch:
   ```
   git checkout <your-branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<your-branch-name>` with the branch for your module (see the list below).

**Example:**
```
git checkout module-3-curriculum-management
```

4. Verify you're on the correct branch:
   ```
   git branch
   ```
   (The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk *)

Now you can start working in your module branch!

# Team Guide: Getting Started

All module branches have already been created. Each team member should:

1. Identify your assigned module and its corresponding branch from the list below.
2. Switch to your module branch using:
   - `git checkout <your-branch-name>`
3. Work only in your respective branch. When pushing or pulling code, always do so with respect to your module branch:
   - To push: `git push origin <your-branch-name>`
   - To pull: `git pull origin <your-branch-name>`

**Branch names:**
- `module-1-user-auth-system`
- `module-2-master-data-management`
- `module-3-curriculum-management`
- `module-4-scheduling-algorithm`
- `module-5-frontend-ui`
- `module-6-report-generation`

Do not add code or implementation details to this README; use it only as a reference for module responsibilities and project structure. Begin development in your branch, following the module guidelines. Use this document as a guide for your tasks and inter-module dependencies.
